            * **If `mode` is 'Tender'**: Your primary goal is to extract `contract_value` and `deadline`. You should also identify the key companies involved in the tender (e.g., the buyer, the winner) and list them in the `company_sentiments` with appropriate sentiment (e.g., Positive for the winner).
